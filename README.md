:speech_balloon: If you're interested in this project as a recruiter or with similar intention,  
I'd suggest reading the  
["Demo & Examples"](./resources/examples.md) section, as well as the  
["Architecture"](./resources/architecture.md)" section.

:construction_worker_man: The project is currently under development, as it requires many modules - each of which could be its own product - We're postponing a complete writeup of the project until all of our MVPs are complete.
